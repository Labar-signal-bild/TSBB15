\subsection{Occlusion}
Occlusion is the problem of keeping track of object when they disapear or are partially hidden. For example it occurs when two object cross path. Bellow is a summary of how this problem can be solved.

From homepage:
Should handle occlusions, using one of the following\\
foreground modelling (i.e. region descriptors)\\
prediction (e.g. using a Kalman filter)\\
ground plane modeling\\
KLT tracking

\subsubsection{Motion model}
A motion model is necessary to determine where the object that is being tracked is headed. The reason for wanting to determine where an object is headed is mostly so that it is possible to find an object if it has been lost. This can help solve different occlusion problems.

If an object walks behind a wall and then returns it should be possible to create a motion model such that when it return we can say with a certainty that it is the same object. This can solved with diffrent methods but here we are mostly going to focu on the
