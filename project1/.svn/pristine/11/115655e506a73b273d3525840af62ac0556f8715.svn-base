\section{Project Goal}
The goal of this project is to develop a tracker that can track objects in a simple sequence of images. The images that are going to be tracked are from the open source datasets\textit{ CAVIAR, pets 2001 } and \textit{changedetection.net}. The tracker should be able to identify the objects in the datasets and the accuracy of results will be evaluated in comparison to the ground truth, which is acquired from the datasets. Moreover, the tracker should be robust enough to handle the occlusion of objects, shadows, specular reflections and a changing background environment, such as that from moving trees.
